# fossasia-2016-google-calendar
A quick and dirty little thing that takes FOSSASIA 2016 schedule and creates Google Calendars out of it.

It takes in open data from FOSSASIA for its schedule [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/open-event-scraper/master/out/sessions.json] and uses it to import it as events into Google Calendars.

Apparently there are over 300 events in the 3-days, it makes it hard to have it all in one big calendar.

I've separated different topics (they call it `tracks`) into separate calendars, so you can filter events based on your
topic of interest when deciding which talk to attend.
